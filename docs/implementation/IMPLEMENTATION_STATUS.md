### Documented live diagnostic coverage limitation (accepted)

Focused live screenshot proved core Directional Context READY publication and horizon separation. Expanded diagnostic fields were **not** manually observed live and remain covered by deterministic automated tests only:

- current and previous auction IDs
- completed-transition count
- detailed TPO value relationship
- detailed TPO POC migration
- exact VPOC migration evidence
- OTF completed-period count and streak counts
- individual Directional StateVersion values
- input fingerprint/version

This limitation does not alter Directional semantics and does not require further operator toggle testing.

### Phase 1D present (locked)

- Multi-horizon descriptive Directional Context (Structural / Tactical / OTF / Execution=Unavailable)
- Deterministic pairwise categorical migration + conservative state table
- Completed-auction structural aggregation (no fixed N-day window)
- Developing tactical context vs previous completed Primary
- One-Time Framing from completed TPO periods only (DevelopingUp/Down/Broken/Mixed)
- Narrow completed TPO period production feed from ClassicTpoEngine
- Input fingerprint publish reuse; price-only location refresh when evidence unchanged
- GPS card rows; diagnostics OFF by default; no Long/Short/Buy/Sell/Thesis/score
- Module default OFF; Directional Ready does not clear global DATA DEGRADED

### Explicitly deferred (Phase 1E+)

- Auction Episode / Acceptance / Re-entry
- Orderflow interpretation / FAR/AAC / Thesis / Entry / Risk
- Execution directional horizon
- Calibrated OTF ConfirmedUp/ConfirmedDown threshold
- Weekly/monthly profile horizons
- Thin Participation / Settlement / Day Structure production classifier
- Score / probability / automatic execution
