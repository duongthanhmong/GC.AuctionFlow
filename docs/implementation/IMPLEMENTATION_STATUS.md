### Documented live state-machine coverage limitation (accepted)

Focused live gate proved Episode PARTIAL publication, live trade admission, Confirmed-reference eligibility, natural active episodes, and Centerline observation (AttemptCount 0; side excursion tracked). Repeated-attempt / geometric re-entry / auction-expiry / retirement / disable-reenable / stale-order / exact revision / history-overlap / LocalPoc-tie transitions were **not** all manually observed live and remain covered by deterministic automated tests only. This does not alter Episode semantics and does not require further operator-manufactured crossings.

### Live AWAITING TRADES defect (fixed before closeout)

- **Observed:** `TRADES: OBSERVED` while `EPISODES: AWAITING TRADES` with 16 eligible references.
- **Root cause:** `OnNewTrades` gated Episode behind `EnableTradeStreamProbe` (default OFF).
- **Fix (D-P1E-002):** normalize once; Episode admission always; probe gates only for probe enqueue.

### Phase 1E present (locked)

- Event-driven Auction Episode Observation from normalized `NewTradeObservation` (`OnNewTrade` / `OnNewTrades`)
- Trade admission independent of Trade Stream Probe enablement
- Confirmed Previous Primary + Confirmed Composite references only (Developing excluded)
- One active episode per `(PrimaryAuctionId, ReferenceId)`; AttemptCount on boundary outside transitions
- Centerline: CrossCount + side excursions; never OutsideAttempt/ReentryDeveloping; AttemptCount stays 0
- Boundary geometric ReentryDeveloping only (no Acceptance)
- Per-auction dedup ledger; Primary Auction change → Expired + ledger clear
- GPS/card rows; diagnostics OFF by default; module default OFF
- No Episode overlay, alerts, Sweep/FAR/AAC/Long-Short/thesis

### Explicitly deferred (Phase 1F+)

- Acceptance / stable re-entry Resolution
- Approach distance / intra-auction calibrated reset
- FAR / AAC / Orderflow interpretation / Thesis / Entry / Risk
- Episode chart overlay / ATAS alerts
- Exact historical trade reconstruction (unavailable on chart load)

### Documented live raw-feature coverage limitation (accepted)

Focused live gate proved Orderflow PARTIAL publication, ordinary trade admission with Probe OFF, truthful Unknown-aggressor accounting (Ask/Bid unavailable), mathematically safe Classified Delta/CVD/coverage, LIVEONLYMIDAUCTION coverage, Episode Orderflow PARTIAL, DATA DEGRADED independence, and MBO BLOCKED. Ask/Bid classified paths, complete classification READY, mixed-side reconciliation, nonzero Delta/CVD, full per-price ledger, complete Episode aggregates, timing metrics, cumulative revision replacement, auction/epoch/disable–re-enable resets, LiveOnlyFromAuctionStart transition, revision sequences, out-of-order rejection, and deterministic replay remain **automated-only** coverage. This does not alter raw Orderflow semantics and does not require further operator-manufactured aggressor events.

### Phase 2A present (locked)

- One authoritative `TradeStreamAtasMapper.MapNewTrade` → `ExecutedTradeEvent` path
- Cumulative callbacks not authoritative for executed totals (`CUMULATIVE_CALLBACKS_NOT_AUTHORITATIVE_FOR_EXECUTED_TOTALS`)
- Current-auction aggregate + per-price ledger + Episode raw aggregate
- Classified Delta/CVD; Unknown aggressor explicit; timing raw only
- Module default OFF; GPS rows; diagnostics OFF by default; no overlay/alerts
- Does not mutate Profile/Composite/Reference/Directional/Episode/Evidence

### Explicitly deferred (Phase 2B+)

- Imbalance / stacked imbalance / Big Trade classification
- Absorption / exhaustion / Effort vs Result / Trade Facilitation
- Acceptance/Re-entry Resolution / FAR / AAC / Thesis / Entry / Risk

### Documented live evidence-lifecycle coverage limitation (accepted)

Focused live gate proved Evidence PARTIAL publication, natural UpperBoundary evidence set, finite descriptive ratios, geometric re-entry observation, Local POC displacement, observer-only behavior (Episode REENTRYDEVELOPING unchanged), DATA DEGRADED independence, and MBO BLOCKED. Full outside/inside segmentation, LowerBoundary symmetry, zero-denominator ratios, repeated attempts, exact revision sequences, lifecycle freeze/reset, Centerline not-applicable, bid/ask variants, compatibility fail-closed, and deterministic replay remain **automated-only** coverage. This does not alter Evidence/Episode semantics and does not require further operator-manufactured crossings.

### Phase 1F present (locked)

- Read-only `EpisodeMeasurementEvent` feed from Phase 1E admission
- Immutable Acceptance/Re-entry evidence vectors (measurement only)
- Observation states: Acceptance Early/Developing/Unresolved; Reentry GeometricReentry/Developing/Unresolved
- Centerline: `CENTERLINE_ACCEPTANCE_GEOMETRY_NOT_APPLICABLE` — no canonical outside ratios
- EvidenceId `AREV|{EpisodeId}|ACCEPTANCE_REENTRY_EVIDENCE_POLICY_V1` stable per EpisodeId
- LIVE_ONLY history; unavailable fields explicit (no fabricated zeros)
- Module default OFF; GPS rows; diagnostics OFF by default; no overlay/alerts
- Does not mutate Episode State / Resolution / AttemptCount

### Explicitly deferred (resolution / later phases)

- Acceptance Established / Failed
- Stable Reacceptance / Reentry Failed
- FAR / AAC / Thesis / Entry / Risk / Long-Short
- OutsideCloseRatio / TPO outside / Local Value rebuild / OldValueReclaimFailure / RetestHoldQuality
- Opposite-aggression effectiveness
- Invented acceptance/maintenance/stable-reentry thresholds

### Phase 1D present (locked)

- Multi-horizon descriptive Directional Context (Structural / Tactical / OTF / Execution=Unavailable)
- Deterministic pairwise categorical migration + conservative state table
- Completed-auction structural aggregation (no fixed N-day window)
- Developing tactical context vs previous completed Primary
- One-Time Framing from completed TPO periods only (DevelopingUp/Down/Broken/Mixed)
- Narrow completed TPO period production feed from ClassicTpoEngine
- Input fingerprint publish reuse; price-only location refresh when evidence unchanged
- GPS card rows; diagnostics OFF by default; no Long/Short/Buy/Sell/Thesis/score
- Module default OFF; Directional Ready does not clear global DATA DEGRADED

### Explicitly deferred after Phase 1D (partially superseded)

- ~~Auction Episode~~ — **Phase 1E LOCKED**
- Acceptance / Re-entry Resolution — **Phase 1F LOCKED (measurement only; Resolution still NOT STARTED)**
- ~~Orderflow raw features~~ — **Phase 2A LOCKED**
- Orderflow interpretation / FAR/AAC / Thesis / Entry / Risk
- Execution directional horizon
- Calibrated OTF ConfirmedUp/ConfirmedDown threshold
- Weekly/monthly profile horizons
- Thin Participation / Settlement / Day Structure production classifier
- Score / probability / automatic execution
